    "As we talked about during last week’s class Pandas is a very rich package that enables us to conduct many types of analysis, wrangling and visualizations. Working with data, formats like CSV’s , Geojsons and Shapefiles is made easy and so much less intimidating by the use of a few pretty simple command lines! \n",

    "Last week we have seen that functions like summarizing, describing as well as making changes in the initial data are very straight forward in Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will learn how to use more Pandas' functionalities. We will use these in conjunction with other packages as well as with other Pandas functionalists we used last week. Acknowledging that things are intertwined, in the next few weeks we will build our knowledge of working with different Python packages. We will also use more and more functionalities and commands with time while also using the simple functions. This method will hopefully help us build strong data analytics programming knowledge that you can use in your future academic studies and careers 📊📈"

Smoothing a dataset means to remove outliers and see the general trend rather than the value for each single datapoint. There are a few different ways to smooth data.

In this method, instead of calculating one average for the entire data, the average is calcualted in constant intervals. Using rolling means in time series is very common. The main reason is that timeseries include a large amount of observations. By displaying rolling means instead of the actual data, we can show trends. \n",

    "\n",
    "Many fields use timeseires analysis for forcasting. That means that looking into a specific period there might be a way to predict the future. That assumes that the \"history repeats itself\". But is that always true? Are the trends we are seeing with COVID-19 cases and deaths are likely to repeat themselves? Given social distanincing and that most of us chaged our lives completly in the past few weeks, we are now still seeing cases and deaths that are likely the result of contamination from 2-3 weeks ago. Another element is that we only have data from 36 days (since the 1st case). 36 days are not enough to really understand trends and being able to predict unsing timeseries analysis. In addition we still can not understand seasonality, which usually is a key to foracsting in timeseries analysis.  \n",
